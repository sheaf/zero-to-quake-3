#+TITLE: Zero to Quake 3

Trying to build as much of Quake 3 as I can using Haskell & Vulkan.

* Todo
** [ ] Fix on-termination errors :correctness:

** [ ] Add texturing :progress:

** [ ] Determine the presentation queue :correctness:

** [ ] Check for VK_KHR_SWAPCHAIN_EXTENSION_NAME :correctness:

** [ ] Triple buffering :correctness:

** [ ] Frame fences to limit in flight frames :correctness:

** [ ] Check that VK_KHR_swapchain is supported :correctness:

** [ ] Use cabal2nix to generate Nix environment :refactoring:

** [ ] Move logging from main to functions themselves :refactoring:

* <2018-09-18 Tue>
** [X] Fixed physics timestep :correctness:
** [X] Parse the entities lump for the initial spawn point :correctness:
* <2018-09-14 Fri>
** [X] Better input handling :correctness:
* <2018-09-13 Thu>

** [X] Remove accidental rotation of the world :bugs:
** [X] Use the Vulkan correction matrix :correctness:

** [X] Weird z-fighting :bugs:

** [X] Correctly determine the format of the depth buffer :correctness:
